Hello,

Attached is all of the code for running our map-reduce methods. We use input arguments to specify which files we want to run on, with our configuration being args[0] = customers.csv path, args[1] = transactions.csv path, and args[2] = output path. In the case of Query 1, we did not need transactions.csv so args[0] is the customers.csv path and args[1] is the output path.

For query 4, we tried our best to squeeze the solution into one map reduce step. Currently, it runs fine and generates a large output, however, the last 10 lines are accurate. In the last 10 lines, like the project description states, there is one line per area code, containing info on a per-area-code basis for number of customers, and min and max transactions. We tried to make the output ONLY 10 lines, however this would require the reducer function to intake only 10 items, or more than 10 items but only 10 items related to area code. Because of this, we could not find a better solution. We also experimented with using area code as a key, combining the customer and transaction files in one map function, and using a combiner, however all of these solutions produced large output files such as the solution we have now. (We emailed the professor regarding this query but got no response, so we made the assumption that this was an acceptable solution.)

For some reason, the Query 4 code ran on my machine but not Maxine's so here is the output pasted into here in case it does not run on your machine:

1,4929,10.001711,999.9992
2,4964,10.000531,999.9963
3,4993,10.004426,999.99994
4,5023,10.018705,999.992
5,5033,10.002714,999.9926
6,4991,10.004662,999.9898

9,5088,10.001181,999.9989
10,4982,10.0131,999.9998

Columns: Area code, customers in that area code, min transaction on all customers in that area code, max transaction of all customers in that area code.

If you have any questions regarding running the code or if we should re-do query 4, please email us at jpdykstra@wpi.edu and mshi2@wpi.edu.

Thank you!
